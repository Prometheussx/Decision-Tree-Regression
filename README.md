# Decision-Tree-Regression

## Overview

This project demonstrates decision tree regression for predicting grandstand prices based on the grandstand level. It uses the scikit-learn library in Python.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version X.X)
- NumPy (version X.X)
- Pandas (version X.X)
- Matplotlib (version X.X)
- Scikit-learn (version X.X)

You can install these prerequisites using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
```
## Usage
* Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erdem-sokullu/decision-tree-regression.git
```
* Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd decision-tree-regression
```
* Run the script:
```bash
 python decision_tree_regression.py
```
## Results
The project will display a scatter plot of the grandstand level and grandstand price, as well as the decision tree regression line.
